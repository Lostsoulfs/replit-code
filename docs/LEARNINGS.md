- **PR drift audit is free without an API key.** `scripts/audit-drift.mjs` is a
  dependency-free deterministic auditor; CI (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`)
  posts via the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` and applies only safe auto-fixes
  (prettier / eslint --fix). Semantic claim-vs-code review is done by the
  in-session auditor (runs on the session, also free). The paid Anthropic API
  was only ever needed for semantic checks _in CI_ — skipped. See
  `docs/DRIFT-AUDIT.md`. GitHub Actions pushes made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not
  retrigger workflows, so the auto-fix commit can't cause an audit loop. Fork
  PRs get a read-only token, so the job is gated to same-repo PRs.

- **Pixi v8 `renderer.generateTexture({ frame })` needs a `Rectangle` instance**,
  not a plain `{ x, y, width, height }` object. Passing a plain object throws
  `e.frame?.copyTo is not a function`. Fix: `import { Rectangle } from 'pixi.js'`
  and pass `new Rectangle(0, 0, w, h)`. (Hit in `src/symbols.js`, `src/effects.js`.)

- **Headless/CI Chromium uses software WebGL (SwiftShader)** with no GPU/vsync,
  so `app.ticker.FPS` reads absurdly low there. Do **not** treat low FPS in a
  headless container as a perf regression — verify smoothness on a real GPU.

- **GitHub Pages deploy requires Pages to be enabled** (repo Settings → Pages →
  Source: "GitHub Actions"). On a **private** repo it also needs a paid plan.
  The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) therefore always uploads a
  downloadable `slot-build` artifact and only attempts the Pages deploy when
  Pages is configured, so CI stays green regardless of plan.

- **Reel determinism** (`src/reels.js`): the outcome is decided first, then the
  strip slice that will be visible at the integer stop position is overwritten
  and eased into with `easeOutBack` (gives the bounce). Motion blur scales with
  reel speed via a `BlurFilter`.

- **Registering a SessionStart hook is gated by the harness.** Writing
  `.claude/settings.json` (hook registration and/or permission allow-rules) is
  treated as self-modification and is blocked unless the user explicitly
  authorizes it / adds the permission rule themselves. The hook _script_ can be
  created freely; only the settings registration needs user action.
