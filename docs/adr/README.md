# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

An ADR captures **one architecturally significant decision**: the context, the
choice, and its consequences. ADRs answer **"why"**; the spec (`docs/SPEC.md`)
answers **"what"**. They are append-only history — supersede, don't rewrite.

Format: [Michael Nygard's template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).
To add one: copy `0000-template.md` to the next number, fill it in, set Status.
